Description: Compute multiple types of correlations analysis (Pearson correlation, R^2 
  coefficient of linear regression, Cramer's V measure of association, 
  Distance Correlation,The Maximal Information Coefficient,
  Uncertainty coefficient and Predictive Power Score) in large dataframes
  with mixed columns classes(integer, numeric, factor and character)
  in parallel backend.
  This package also has a C++ implementation of the Average correlation clustering algorithm and distance correlation t-test.
