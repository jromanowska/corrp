Description: Compute multiple types of correlation analyses, including 
    Pearson correlation, R^2 coefficient of linear regression, Cramer's 
    V measure of association, distance correlation, the Maximal 
    Information Coefficient, uncertainty coefficient, and Predictive 
    Power Score in large data frames with mixed column classes 
    (integer, numeric, factor, and character) using a parallel 
    backend. This package also includes a C++ implementation of 
    the average correlation clustering algorithm and distance 
    correlation t-test.
